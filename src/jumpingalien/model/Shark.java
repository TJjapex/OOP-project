public class Shark {
	
	// * capable of jumping while their bottom perimeter is overlapping with water or impassable terrain
	// * start the game with 100 hit-points
	// * typically appear in water tiles and do not lose hit-points while submerged in water
	// * after 0.2s they lose 6 hit-points per 0.2s while in contact with air
	// * lose hit-points upon touching magma (same as Mazub)
	// * horizontal acceleration is equal to 1.5 [m/s^2]
	// * maximal horizontal velocity is equal to 4 [m/s]
	// * initial vertical velocity is equal to 2 [m/s]
	// * jump will occur at the start of a horizontal movement period and the Shark stops jumping at the end of
	//   that period
	// * movement periods have a duration of 1s to 4s
	// * at least 4 non-jumping periods of random movement in between the end of one jump and the start
	//   of the next one
	// * Sharks fall while their bottom perimeter is not overlapping with impassable terrain or other game objects
	// * Sharks stop falling as soon as they are submerged in water (top perimeter is overlapping with a water tile)
	// * when submerged in water, capable of diving and rising: - each non-jumping movement period they shall have
	// 															  a random vertical acceleration between or equal to
	//															  - 0.2 [m/s^2] and 0.2 [m/s^2]
	//															- vertical acceleration set back to 0 when top or
	//															  bottom perimeter are not overlapping with a
	//															  water tile any more and at the end of the 
	//															  movement period
	// * lose 50 hit-points when making contact with Mazub or Slimes
	// * do not attack each other but block each others' movement
	// * Plants do not block Sharks
